# Scan With Nmap

## Overview
The "Scan With Nmap" project is designed to help users learn how to perform network scanning and reconnaissance using Nmap. This tool will guide you through the process of identifying hosts and open ports on a specified network or IP range, and generating a comprehensive report on discovered devices and services.

**Important Note:** Scanning networks or systems without permission is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have explicit authorization to scan and assess any network or IP range.

## Features
- Perform network scanning using Nmap.
- Identify active hosts and open ports within a specified range.
- Generate detailed reports of discovered devices and services.

## Contents
- **`scan_report.txt`**: A sample report generated from a Nmap scan.

## How It Works
The provided script automates the process of running Nmap scans on specified network ranges or IP addresses. It captures the output and formats it into a readable report.

### Process Flow
1. The script runs Nmap with user-defined parameters.
2. Nmap performs the scan and returns results on discovered hosts and open ports.
3. The script parses Nmap's output and generates a report (`report.txt` or similar).

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Nmap installed on your system.
- Python 3.x
- Python packages: `subprocess` (standard library, no need to install)

### Running the Script
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Scan-With-NMAP.git
